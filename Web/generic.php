									<h1>Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</h1>
								</header>
								<p>Shivaji Bhosle(19 feb 1630 – 3 April 1680), also known as Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, was an Indian warrior king and a member of the Bhonsle Maratha clan. Shivaji carved out an enclave from the declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur that formed the genesis of the Maratha Empire. In 1674, he was formally crowned as the Chhatrapati (Monarch) of his realm at Raigad.</p>
								
								<p>यशवंत कीर्तिवंत । सामर्थ्यवंत वरदवंत ।<br/>पुण्यवंत नीतिवंत । जाणता राजा ॥<br/>या भूमंडळाचे ठायी । धर्मरक्षी ऐसा नाही ।<br/>महाराष्ट्र धर्म राहिला काही । तुम्हा कारणे ॥<br/><br/>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, one who is respected by entire cross section of Indians, the individual whose struggle against an imperial power beacame an icon of freedom fighters in the Indian independence struggle. He’s a source of inspiration and pride to the past geneartions and will continue to inpire future generations. Remembered as adjust and wise king and his rule as one of the six golden ages in Indian history.</p>
<p>Indian warrior king and a member of the Bhonsle Maratha clan, carved out an enclave from the declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur that formed the genesis of the Maratha Empire. At a tender age of 14, Shivaji Maharaj started his journey of creating his own kingdom. Mughals were probably the second most powerful empire in the world at that time. The odds were stacked against young Shivaji. But by bravery and hard work, Shivaji Maharaj outwitted the Mughals time and again. He not only brought a glimmer of hope but values like independence, freedom of religion, social justice to a barren land.</p>
